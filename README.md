# Simple-Tip-calculator-

John and his family went on a holiday and went to 3 different restaurants. The bills were $124, $48 and $268.
To tip the waiter a fair amount, john created a simple tip calculator (as function) He likes to tip 20% of the bill when the bill is a less than $50,15% when the bill is between $50 and $200.
In the end john would like to have 2 arrays. 
1)	Containing all three tips (one for each bill)
2)	Containing all three final paid amounts (bills*tip)

 (To calculate 20% of a value, simply multiply if with 20/100 =0.2)
